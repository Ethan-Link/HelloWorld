Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing
And jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing
Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop
Has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime
In jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing
In Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time
Is a swell time
To go gliding in
A one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse
Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle
In the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock
